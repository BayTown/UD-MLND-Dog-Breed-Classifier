# Udacity MLND Capstone Project Dog Breed Classifier

## In this project I will develop a CNN to recognize dog breeds

On the basis of a image of a dog, an algorithm is supposed to give an estimate of the breed of the dog.

## Domain Background

If dog owners are unsure about their dog's breed, a dog-breed classifier can help them identify their dog's breed.
This would be especially helpful for inexperienced dog owners. If a dog owner have doubts about the breed before buying a dog, i.e.
there is a discrepancy between what the seller says and what you remember about the breed, you can quickly confirm your doubts
with a dog breed classifier or get rid of the world.

These people and also me can be helped by developing a picture classifier that appreciates dog breeds.
This is possible via the image classification in the area of deep learning, which is part of machine learning.
Image classification refers to a process in computer vision that can classify an image according to its visual content.
A convolutional neural network, CNN for short, is preferably used here.
CNN are a specialized type of neural network for processing data that have the structure of a grid.
Image classification with CNN saw the light of day in 1994 with Yann LeCun's LeNet5 and received a huge boost in 2012 with AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky who won the ImageNet competition

In this project I will develop a CNN to recognize dog breeds.
On the basis of a image of a dog, an algorithm is supposed to give an estimate of the breed of the dog.
If the image of a person is given, the algorithm should reproduce the most similar dog breed.
